flow_run2(
  x,
  prefix = NULL,
  swap = TRUE,
  code = TRUE,
  ...,
  out = NULL,
  svg = FALSE,
  browse = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A call or a function}

\item{prefix}{prefix to use for special comments in our code used as block headers,
must start with `"#"`}

\item{swap}{whether to change `var <- if(cond) expr` into
`if(cond) var <- expr` so the diagram displays better}

\item{code}{Whether to display the code in code blocks or only the header, to be
more compact, if `NA`, the code will be displayed only if no header is
defined by special comments.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to `build_nomnoml_code()`}

\item{out}{a path to save the diagram to.
Special values "html", "htm", "png", "pdf", "jpg" and "jpeg" can be used to
export the objec to a temp file of the relevant format and open it,
if a regular path is used the format will be guessed from the extension.}

\item{svg}{only for default or html outut, whether to use svg rendering, rendering
is more robust without it, but it makes text selectable on output which is
 sometimes useful}

\item{browse}{whether to debug step by step (block by block),
can also be a vector of block ids, in this case only those will be considered for browsing}
