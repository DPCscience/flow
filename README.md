# flow <img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="139" />

Visualize as flow diagrams the logic of functions, expressions or
scripts and ease debugging.

  - Call `flow_view()` on a function, a quoted expression, or the path
    of an R script to visualize it.

  - Call `flow_run()` on a call to a function to visualize which logical
    path in the code was taken. Set `browse = TRUE` to debug your
    function block by block (similar to `base::browser()`) as the
    diagram updates.

  - Export to *html*, *png*, *jpeg*, or *pdf*.

  - Use the Rstudio addins to run `flow_view()` or `flow_run()` on your
    selection.

*{flow}* is built on top of Javier Luraschiâ€™s *{nomnoml}* package, which
provides an interface to nomnoml, a tool for drawing sassy UML diagrams
based on syntax with customizable styling.

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("moodymudskipper/flow")
```

## Example

``` r
library(flow)
flow_view(median.default)
```

There are way too many features to show them all on a README, check the
vignette [Draw a
function](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moodymudskipper/flow/master/doc/Draw-a-function.html)
for a deeper dive. More vignette to come\!

The following code gives you a taste of the possibilities.

``` r
# exports (supports png, jpeg, pdf, html)
# shortcuts are available to export to temp file and open 
flow_view(median.default, out = "png")

# visualize which path was taken (relevant S3 method is presented)
vec <- c(1:3, NA)
flow_run(median(vec, na.rm = TRUE))

# works when code fails too (handy to debug!)
flow_run(median(iris))

# step by step exploration
vec <- c(1:3, NA)
flow_run(median(vec, na.rm = TRUE), browse = TRUE)
# then call `d` to draw the diagram at the relevant step
```
